# Fourier Transform

The Fourier transform (FT) decomposes a function of time (a signal) into the frequencies that make it up, in a way similar to how a musical chord can be expressed as the frequencies (or pitches) of its constituent notes. In this sort repository I will be implementing a general Fourier Transform algorithm capable of decomposing a function f(x) = sin(2*a*pi*x) + sin(2*b*pi*x) ... for constants a,b,.. > 0.


Here is an image of the man who came up with this idea.\

## Prerequisites

The Code is written in Python 3.6.5 . If you don't have Python installed you can find it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). If you are using a lower version of Python you can upgrade using the pip package, ensuring you have the latest version of pip.

To install pip run in the command Line
```
python -m ensurepip -- default-pip
```
to upgrade it
```
python -m pip install -- upgrade pip setuptools wheel
```
to upgrade Python
```
pip install python -- upgrade
```
Additional Packages that are required are: [Numpy](http://www.numpy.org/) and  [MatplotLib](https://matplotlib.org/)\

You can donwload them using [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/)
```
pip install numpy MatplotLib
```
or [conda](https://anaconda.org/anaconda/python)
```
conda install numpy MatplotLib
```

## Usage

* Create a fake signal and apply the fourier Transform with ```run.py```
  * Basic Usage : ```python run.py -s a b ... ```
  * Plots the signal, then the decomposition and saves the figures
  * Option:
    * ```python run.py -s a b --n True```
    * Uses my own implementation of the FFT

## Examples

 ```python run.py -s 10 20``` \
